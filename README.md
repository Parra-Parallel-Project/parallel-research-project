## To execute the main.cpp file:

- Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
- Clone or download the repository containing the main.cpp file.
- Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the main.cpp file is located.
- Type the following command to compile the file: `g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp WeightedGraph.cpp`
- Run the compiled file by typing the following command: `./a.out`

> This will execute the main function and display the output on the terminal/command prompt. The output will show the representation of a weighted graph with five nodes and nine edges, as well as the least cost path between the nodes.
